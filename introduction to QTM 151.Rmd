### 1. R Notebook
This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 
It is very similar to Rmarkdown. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

### 2. QTM 151
QTM 150 and QTM 151 are sequel courses about introduction to R programming. We will keep learning more tools of data exploration.

#### Textbooks:

[R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/)

#### Assessments:

- In-lab quizzes 30%
- Weekly Homework 35%
- One in-lab exam  15%
- Project 20%

### 3. Review

At the beginning, let's review what we have learned in QTM 150, the basic data visualisation and manipulation.

#### Dataset Today: Tipping in the restaurant:
Food server's tips in restaurants may be influenced by
many factors including the nature of the restaurant,
size of the party, table locations in the restaurant, ... 
To make appropriate assignments for the food servers, restaurant
managers need to know what these factors are.

In one restaurant, a food server recorded the following
data on all customers they had served during a interval
of two and a half months in early 1990, resulting in
observations on 244 dining parties. 

```{r}
tips<-read.csv("tips.csv")
```

Variables Description: 

- TOTBILL: Total bill, including tax, in dollars
- TIP: Tip in dollars
- SEX: Sex of person paying bill (M, F)
- SMOKER: Smoker in party? (No, Yes)
- DAY: Thur, Fri, Sat, Sun
- TIME: day, night
- SIZE: Size of the party


#### Explore the dataset
```{r}
head(tips)
str(tips)
summary(tips)
```

Question: What factors affect tip rate?

Tip:

```{r, eval=TRUE}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(tips, aes(x=tip))+
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.2)
```


Tip vs total bill:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(tips, aes(x=totbill, y=tip))+
geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(method="lm")
```


Tip vs sex:

```{r, eval=F}  
ggplot(tips, aes(x=sex, y=tip))+
  geom_boxplot()
```

Tip vs sex and time:

```{r, eval=F}
ggplot(tips, aes(x=sex, y=tip))+
  geom_boxplot()+
  facet_grid(~time)

ggplot(tips, aes(x=sex:time, y=tip))+
  geom_boxplot()
```

Tip vs total bill by sex:

```{r, eval=F}
ggplot(tips, aes(x=totbill, y=tip))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se=F)+
  facet_grid(~sex)


ggplot(tips, aes(x=totbill, y=tip))+
  geom_point(aes(color=sex))+
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se=F)+
  geom_smooth(aes(group=sex, color=sex), method = "lm", se=F)
```

Tip vs total bill by sex and time

```{r, eval=F}
ggplot(tips, aes(x=totbill, y=tip))+
  geom_point()+
  facet_grid(sex~time)

## provide a scatterplot between totbill and tip, set the color of points to sex, shape to time, and give two lm smooth lines to sex
```

### Quick plot from ggplot:

qplot is a short cut of ggplot

```{r}
# qplot(x, y, data=, geom=, color=, shape=, size=, alpha=, facets=, xlab=, ylab=, main=,)
```

```{r, eval=F}
qplot(tip, geom = "histogram", binwidth=0.3, data=tips)


```
